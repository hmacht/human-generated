## Our Mission
Human Generated mission is to mark text online that is human generated. Upload content and then you will receive a seal of authenicity and a URL for proof. The goal is to become a source of truth for people online.

Building The I.D.H.G.C (International Databse of Human Generated Content). This resource will prove to be vital in the coming years.

## Archetecture

Design

Our main design principal is future-proof. We are not getting to fancy with features, this needs to be as striped down as possible. Certifying content is the main goal, and it should be as easy as possible.


Main Model is out ```VerificationRequest```

This holds all data about incoming certificate requests
- ```title```
- ```content```
- ```certificate_url```
- ```status```
